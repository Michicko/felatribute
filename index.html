                <p class="first">Musician and political activist Fela Kuti was born on October
                    15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Kuti was the son of a Protestant minister, Reverend Ransome-Kuti.
                    His mother, Funmilayo, was a political activist.
                    As a child, Kuti learned piano and drums and led his school choir. In the 1950s, Kuti told his
                    parents that he was moving to London, England, to study medicine, but wound up attending the Trinity
                    College of Music instead. While at Trinity, Kuti studied classical music and developed an awareness
                    of American jazz.

                <p>Beginning in the 1960s, Fela Kuti pioneered his own unique style of music called "Afrobeat." Kuti
                    sang in a combination of Pidgin English and Yoruba.
                    Rebelling against oppressive regimes through his music came at a heavy cost. Kuti was arrested 200
                    times and endured numerous beatings, but continued to write political lyrics, producing 50 albums
                    before he died on August 2, 1997, in Lagos, Nigeria.
